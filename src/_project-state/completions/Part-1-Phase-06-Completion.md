# Part 1 · Phase 06 — Assessment flow UI · Completion Report

**Phase:** Part 1 · Phase 06 — Assessment flow UI
**Executing Claude:** Code
**Date completed:** 2026-06-23
**Branch:** `phase-1.06-assessment-flow`
**Commits:** `4dec370` (implementation) + a follow-up doc commit backfilling these refs
**PR:** [#5](https://github.com/DinovLazar/IqUp-V2/pull/5)

## What shipped

- **The assessment runs end-to-end locally** — from `/`, a child can go landing → setup → pre-start → practice (with device calibration) → all 7 task types adaptively (on the 1.05 engine) → completion + the "IQ UP! Истражувач" reward. Nothing is persisted before the (1.08) lead form.
- **7 task renderers + a shared answer option**, each a thin React render of `generateItem` output over a pure, node-tested `view.ts` (presenters + interaction→response builders). Gf (matrix/series), Gv (rotation/odd-one-out), Gsm (Corsi), Gs (symbol-search with the one visible timer), EF (Tower of London), Glr (paired-associate), CT (sequence/debug/loop/condition/maze). **Correctness derives from each item's answer key, never from time** (only Gs's score sees time).
- **A timing layer** — a pure silent per-item stopwatch + idle/tab-blur gap recorder (`src/features/timing/`), a gentle idle nudge after ~22 s ("Сè е во ред?" + Продолжи, no countdown/penalty), and device-calibration capture on the first practice item. Output is exactly the engine's `ResponseTiming` (`{ elapsedMs, idleGaps? }`).
- **The real landing** (`/`, photo-forward with dashed placeholders, MK/EN switch, inline disclaimer) and the **`/procena` flow** (age gate 5–13 with MK block, mandatory 5–7 parent-confirm screen, completion + reward), plus a **`/kit` extension** with every renderer live + the answer-option/idle-nudge/reward-badge.
- **32 new Vitest tests** (timing, response→key mapping, end-to-end flow over the 5 fixtures); repo total **16 files / 133 tests**.

## Decisions made on the fly

Logged as **D-070 … D-077** in `Decisions.md`. Highlights for Chat to surface:

1. **D-071 — timing-shape mismatch flagged, not silently fixed.** The 1.05 `ResponseTiming` is `{ elapsedMs, idleGaps? }` with **no field for the device-calibration baseline** the DoD asks to capture. The baseline is captured at session level (inert, like `parentAssistMode`) and handed to 3.01; the 1.05 contract is untouched. **Chat/Lazar should decide in 3.01 whether to extend the contract.**
2. **D-070 — timing layer lives in `src/features/timing/`, not under `src/features/assessment`**, so the timing React hook (the app's only `performance.now`) doesn't trip the 1.05 purity scan; the pure stopwatch/calibration stay node-tested.
3. **D-073 — progress maps onto the 5 index-groups** (planning = ef+gs, stem = ct+glr, …); the puzzle-brain fills by COUNT of finished groups (the handover's "N од 5" semantics), since administration order ≠ index order, avoiding a fork of the 1.03 `PuzzleBrain`.
4. **D-075 — `noValidate` on the setup form** so the friendly MK age-range message governs (native `min`/`max` was silently blocking submission). **D-076** — original glyph/stimulus visual language extended consistently to all 7 task types (no 1.02 mockup geometry to copy, mirrors D-045). **D-077** — one practice per signal; CT shows one sub-type as its example.

## Surprises / off-spec changes

- **Native HTML5 constraint validation silently blocked the age gate.** With `min={5} max={13}` on the number input, the browser blocked form submission for out-of-range ages, so the custom MK "5–13" message never ran (and the block looked broken). Fixed with `noValidate` (D-075) — caught during in-browser verification.
- **Vitest is node-only and `.ts`-only.** The renderers were therefore architected as a pure `.ts` `view.ts` (presenters + response builders, node-tested) + thin `.tsx` shells, mirroring the existing `pentagon.ts`/`pentagon.tsx` split — so render-determinism and response→key mapping are unit-tested without a DOM, and the React layer is browser-verified instead.
- **The idle nudge is suppressed during Gs** (the timed task) — showing a "take your time" nudge inside a 20–25 s speed game would contradict it (D-072).

## Tests run + results

- `npm run build` ✓ (routes `/`, `/procena`, `/kit`, `/_not-found`) · `npm run lint` ✓ (0 problems) · `npm run typecheck` ✓ · `npm test` ✓ (**16 files, 133 tests** — was 13/101) · `npm run format:check` ✓.
- **New coverage:** render-determinism (Gv view stable; instructionKey covers every variant), response→answer-key mapping per task type via the real `gradeItem` (correct grades correct, wrong grades wrong, correctness time-independent), timing capture (idle gap recording + finish shape + calibration + the scoring `effectiveTime` contract), and the flow over all 5 `fixtures.ts` profiles (reproduces the engine path, deterministic, one practice per task type, all 5 sections complete).
- **In-browser (preview):** landing; age gate (3/4 blocked with the MK message, 8/6 accepted); the mandatory 5–7 parent confirm gating "Почни"; gf practice (series) → real (matrix) with the practice→real transition; and every renderer eyeballed in `/kit` (Gv uniform-scale polygons, Corsi board, Gs grid + calm orange timer ring + auto-submit on expiry, EF tower with coloured balls, CT maze with a wall-aware d-pad, condition arrows, the idle nudge, the assembled brain + reward badge). No console errors.
- **Adversarial review:** CodeRabbit + Codex are still not connected, so (as in 1.05) a multi-agent adversarial review pass was run internally — 5 review dimensions (response↔key correctness, purity/determinism, accessibility, scope/contract, spec/i18n) each with **independent per-finding verification** (refute-by-default). Outcome: **3 confirmed**, all addressed:
  - **must-fix (a11y):** the Corsi tiles were click-only SVG `<rect>`s — no keyboard, role, or name, making the scored Gsm task uncompletable for keyboard/switch users. **Fixed:** rebuilt the board as a flash-only backdrop SVG + real, named, ≥44px `<button>` tap targets with the standard `focus-visible` ring (verified live: 6 `<button>`s, `aria-label="Плочка N"`, `aria-pressed`, keyboard-operable, taps captured).
  - **should-fix:** skipping the *first* practice silently dropped device calibration (gate was tied to the first domain only). **Fixed:** calibration now lands on the first *engaged* practice and is also attempted on the skip path (refines D-077).
  - **nit:** the disclaimer uses "скрининг" — **kept**, as it is the handover §4.2 canonical placeholder copy (final legal copy is Phase 3.03). The other reviewer findings were refuted on verification (e.g., the CT/maze SVGs route interaction through real buttons; the pure `.ts` cores stay clock/DOM-free).

## Blocked / carryover

- [ ] **3.01 — decide the calibration contract.** The device baseline is captured but inert; 3.01 owns whether to extend `ResponseTiming` or keep it session-side (D-071).
- [ ] **Cowork — real class photos** swap into the landing's dashed placeholders (clean swap path kept).
- [ ] **CodeRabbit + Codex still not connected** (`docs/ai-review-setup.md`) — this PR gets the internal adversarial pass instead.

## What's next

**Phase 1.07 — Report engine + results content:** the deterministic module-assembly report (pentagon + band bars + strengths/growth + activities) over the `AssessmentResult` the engine already produces. The 5 `fixtures.ts` profiles + this flow give 1.07 real end-to-end inputs. (The lead form + on-screen confirmation are 1.08; the PDF is 1.09.)
